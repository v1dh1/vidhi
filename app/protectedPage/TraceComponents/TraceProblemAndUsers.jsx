        <div className='text-stone-300 pt-2'>{"Initially conceived as a sustainability-focused project, the purpose of this initiative was to tackle the challenge of promoting sustainability and supporting small businesses within the TD ecosystem. However, after conducting comprehensive user interviews, we recognized the need to pivot towards a local-first approach, aiming to inclusively address all user demographics. It was also found that TDâ€™s US presence was not strong enough, which led to creating this product which falls outside of traditional banking. The primary goal remained consistent: to develop an app that incentivizes users to engage in sustainable shopping practices while highlighting the significance of local businesses and B-Corps."}</div>
