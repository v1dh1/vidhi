<div className='pt-4 text-stone-700'>{"Existing services (e.g., ride-shares, bike rentals) are typically standalone solutions that require individual apps and accounts, creating a fragmented experience. They do not offer a unified approach to mobility or consider user preferences, budget, or environmental concerns holistically."}</div>
<div className='pt-4 pb-4 text-stone-700'>{"Currently, no single platform currently offers a flexible, subscription-based service that adapts to various transportation needs in real-time. Most platforms lack real-time dynamic suggestions, leading to inefficiencies and user frustration."}</div>
<div className='text-stone-700 pb-8'>{"My hypothesis is: If we provide a subscription-based mobility platform that dynamically suggests optimal transport options based on user preferences and real-time conditions, then users will be more likely to choose sustainable, cost-effective transit solutions over car ownership.

There is space in the market for a single, unified platform that could provide them with various transit options based on their current needs and location."}</div>
<div class="bg-pink-50 text-stone-700 rounded-xl p-4">{"Dependance on solely public transit has often disappointed city-dwellers, as many find it to become increasingly unsafe and/or unreliable to use."}</div>

The profiles of the people who inputted this range were not those with businesses, but rather hobbyists."}</div>
    <div className='text-stone-600 pt-4'>{"The struggle to find a specific amount of a specific product exists, and leads to hobbyists having to leave their projects unfinished. 16% had a buy a new pack of whatever the material was, which is high considering the pool of participants was only 25 people. "}</div>
    <div className='text-stone-600 pt-4 pb-4'>{"The challenges faced by the crafting community are multifaceted, stemming from the intrinsic nature of crafting itselfâ€”a realm where creativity knows no bounds, but practical constraints often hinder the realization of this creativity. At the heart of these challenges lies a paradox: the quest for diverse and quality materials versus the practical limitations of cost, accessibility, and sustainability."}</div>
