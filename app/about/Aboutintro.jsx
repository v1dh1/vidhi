            <div className=''>{"I have 2 years of design & product experience in fintech, logistics, and defense. I'm currently in my 4th year of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I’ve always been drawn to creating, whether it was doodling, building, or experimenting with different crafts. Over the years, exploring a wide variety of hands-on projects helped me realize that crafting isn’t just a hobby, it’s what I’m meant to do. I love turning ideas into tangible, thoughtful creations that spark joy and curiosity. Every piece I make is infused with intention, creativity, and a little bit of fun, because I believe that great design isn’t just seen; it’s felt."}</div>
