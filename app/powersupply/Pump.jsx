This project provided an opportunity to explore the intersection of mechanical and electrical engineering while also honing my skills in design iteration and problem-solving. Over the course of several months, my team and I tackled everything from generator characterization to circuit design and final assembly. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at how this project went from ideation to execution. "}</div>

            {"I took charge of designing experiments to understand the power-generating potential of our setup. Specifically, we needed to measure the current output from our generator under various conditions like voltage, RPM, and rotation methods. This was essential for crafting an efficient power circuit that could convert mechanical energy into usable electrical energy for the phone. I developed a detailed experimental plan to measure these parameters during the next lab session, laying the groundwork for what would become the core of our project."}

The hydroelectric generator we used produced alternating current (AC) due to its rotating components. However, to power a phone, we needed a stable direct current (DC) output. This meant our circuit had to convert AC to DC, stabilize the voltage, and provide a consistent current. We identified the main requirements as AC to DC conversion using a bridge rectifier, voltage stabilisation with capacitors and current regulation for steady output to the lamp."}</div>
